 Known Limitations & Future Improvements
 No authentication or user roles (could be added with ASP.NET Identity or JWT).

 No input validation or error handling middleware.

 No front-end UI (a simple Razor or React frontend could be added).

âš™ Performance optimizations like pagination, filtering, and sorting not yet implemented.

 Tests are minimal; would benefit from full unit and integration test coverage.
